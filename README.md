# Hash Graph Kernels
Source code for our IEEE ICDM 2016 paper [Faster Kernels for Graphs with Continuous Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00064).

# Usage

```Bash
$ python hash_graph_kernels.py
```

Different kernels and data sets can be selected in "hash_graph_kernels.py".

# More Data Sets
